## Call Center Trend Statistics

The telecom industry is highly competitive, with numerous players vying for market share. So Call Centre Managers look for transparency and insights into their center's data to understand and improve Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

- Average speed of answer
 - Agent statistics
